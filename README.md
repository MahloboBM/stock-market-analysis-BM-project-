# Stock Market Analysis - BM Kaggle Projects

This repository contains multiple machine learning projects for stock market analysis and prediction.

## Projects

### 1. Stock Market Analysis Notebook
- `stock_market_project.ipynb` - Main analysis notebook containing data exploration, visualization, and modeling for stock market data

### 2. Hull Tactical Market Prediction
A machine learning project for tactical market prediction using Hull indicators and other financial analysis techniques.

#### Data
The training data for this project is found in `train.csv`. This dataset contains historical market data used to train the prediction models.

#### Project Structure
- `train.csv` - Training dataset containing historical market data
- `test.csv` - Test dataset for model evaluation
- `kaggle_evaluation/` - Evaluation framework and utilities
  - `core/` - Core evaluation modules
  - `default_gateway.py` - Default gateway implementation
  - `default_inference_server.py` - Inference server for model predictions
  - `__init__.py` - Package initialization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (see notebooks for specific imports)

### Running the Analysis

#### Stock Market Analysis Notebook
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `stock_market_project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis

#### Hull Tactical Market Prediction
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed
3. Use `train.csv` for training your models
4. Utilize the evaluation framework in `kaggle_evaluation/` for testing
