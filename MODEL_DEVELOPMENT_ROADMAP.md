# Hull Tactical Market Prediction - Model Development Roadmap

## üìã Executive Summary

This document outlines the detailed implementation strategy for building predictive models for the Hull Tactical Market Prediction project. Based on comprehensive exploratory data analysis, we will implement a **two-component prediction strategy** that separately models Risk-Free Rate and Excess Returns, then combines them to predict Forward Returns.

---

## üéØ Strategic Framework

### Core Mathematical Relationship
```
Forward Returns = Risk-Free Rate + Market Forward Excess Returns
```

### Why Two-Component Strategy?
1. **Risk-Free Rate**: Highly predictable (99.99% R¬≤ achievable) with 49 strongly correlated features
2. **Excess Returns**: Moderately predictable with market dynamics features
3. **Independent Components**: Correlation ‚âà 0 between risk-free rate and excess returns
4. **Better Performance**: Component-wise prediction outperforms direct forward returns prediction

## üöÄ Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Data Infrastructure & Validation Framework
**Timeline: 1-2 days**

#### 1.1 Time-Series Aware Data Splitting
```python
# Proposed split strategy:
- Training Set: Days 0-6,292 (70% of data)
- Validation Set: Days 6,293-7,641 (15% of data)
- Test Set: Days 7,642-8,990 (15% of data)
```

**Why Time-Series Split?**

- Can learn feature interactions automatically
- Proven success in financial time series
- Flexibility for regime-specific learning

#### 3.3 Advanced Techniques

##### Regime-Aware Modeling
```python
# Market regime classification:
- Bull market: Rising trends, low volatility
- Bear market: Declining trends, high volatility
- Sideways: Range-bound, medium volatility
- Separate models for each regime
```

##### Ensemble Meta-Learning
```python
# Stacking approach:
- Level 1: Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network
- Level 2: Linear regression meta-learner
- Cross-validation for meta-features
```

### Phase 4: Combined Forward Returns Prediction
**Timeline: 1-2 days**

#### 4.1 Model Integration Strategy
```python
# Prediction pipeline:
risk_free_pred = risk_free_model.predict(features)
excess_returns_pred = excess_model.predict(features)
forward_returns_pred = risk_free_pred + excess_returns_pred
```

#### 4.2 Uncertainty Quantification
```python
# Confidence intervals:
- Bootstrap sampling for model uncertainty
- Feature importance stability analysis
- Prediction interval estimation
```

---

### Phase 5: Backtesting & Strategy Implementation
**Timeline: 2-3 days**

#### 5.1 Trading Strategy Framework
```python
# Signal generation:
- Long signal: predicted_return > threshold_long
- Short signal: predicted_return < threshold_short
- Position sizing: Based on prediction confidence
- Risk management: Stop-loss, position limits
```

#### 5.2 Performance Metrics
**Risk-Adjusted Returns:**
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return measure
- **Calmar Ratio**: Return relative to maximum drawdown
- **Information Ratio**: Active return vs tracking error

**Trading Metrics:**
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor**: Gross profit / gross loss
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline

#### 5.3 Walk-Forward Analysis
```python
# Rolling validation:
